# Home Assistant Git Exporter

Export your entire Home Assistant configuration to a Git repository of your choice.  
This addon allows you to safely version your setup and optionally share it in public repositories.

## What's New / Improvements

This version includes several improvements for better reliability, security, and maintainability:

* Only text-based files (YAML, JSON, shell scripts) are committed; binaries are automatically excluded.
* Secrets from `secrets.yaml` are redacted before committing.
* Rsync now fully respects the exclude list from the addon configuration, automatically removing deleted or excluded files.
* File permissions are normalized (folders 755, files 644, `.sh` scripts 755).
* Export functions (`HA config`, `Lovelace`, `ESPHome`, `Addons`, `Addon configs`, `Node-RED`) are cleaned up and simplified.
* Commit messages can include `{DATE}` placeholders, automatically replaced with the current timestamp.
* Automatic cleanup of obsolete files in the repository to prevent stale data.

## Example

For an example setup, you can explore my own Home Assistant configuration:
